This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Thanks to the Design Creator
This project uses the free design ["AI Startup Website UI Kit"](https://www.figma.com/design/cAYTeJQoDsad7pPMHA9xjd).
Big thanks to the creators for providing such a fantastic resource for the community!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server (I prefer to use `pnpm` as package manager, but you can use `npm` or `yarn` as well):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:1912](http://localhost:1912) with your browser to see the result.

[//]: # (TODO: deploy the app on Vercel and add the link here)
